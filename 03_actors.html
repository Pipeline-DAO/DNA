                        <h1 id="actors"><a class="header" href="#actors">Actors</a></h1>
<p>Pipeline upgrades the traditional model of crowdfunding/VC investment by bringing in all the key actors of the process, or at least that is the plan.</p>
<p>While creators and creative collectives have certain freedom in their selection of collaborators, a project where all key actors come from the same ecosystem and are transparent via their actions being public increases the odds of a project succeeding. </p>
<p>(On that note and to be discussed elsewhere, a 100% in-ecosystem fulfillment of roles on a project would be an optional, but highly desirable project parameter.)</p>
<p>Actors need to be financially motivated in addition to being in love with a project, hence every actor is entitled to be rewarded through either fixed pay, equity, or a combination of fixed &amp; equity pay.</p>
<p>In terms of voting power and determining the directions the DAO and specific projects take, not all actors are equal.</p>
<p>The following are the current general categories of actors; these may be expanded as our understanding of what’s involved in successfully delivering a creative project grows.</p>
<h3 id="governors"><a class="header" href="#governors">Governors</a></h3>
<p>Governors are top-tier investors with voting rights. These are the early birds who vote for a project’s launch by contributing liquidity of certain magnitude. Based on how the project is structured and the size of the overall investment, Governors may choose to be the only source of funds, the leading source of funds, or <em>a</em> source of funds.</p>
<p>We (will potentially) establish a reasonable threshold of contributions from Governors under which a Pipeline project may not be launched. For instance, “for a project with overall cost of 1m$ USD at least 20% of funds must come from Governors.”</p>
<p>Governors not only bear higher requirements for their contributions (the magnitude of), but also incur higher absolute risk of loss and have more skin in the game (subject to slashing) than potentially any other actor.</p>
<p>Thus their voting power – on non-creative decisions – is <em>triple</em> that of other actors.</p>
<h3 id="oversight-committees"><a class="header" href="#oversight-committees">Oversight Committees</a></h3>
<p>In addition to setting projects in motion, Governors will vote in an oversight committee for each. A committee consists of Emissaries and is led by Warden. The purpose of an Oversight Commitee is to monitor and aide the execution of a project without interfering with the creative force behind it.</p>
<p>An OC helps creators execute on the creative vision and go back to the contributing Governors for decisions and support whenever a dispute arises or the project veers off-track or additional funding is required based on valid arguments. </p>
<p>The Committee will also ensure that a project underway will not knowingly violate copyright and other rights by working alongside with the legal support team. </p>
<p>A Governor can also be a Warden, the person/entity responsible for general oversight and organizational issues, but not an Emissary.</p>
<p>Emissaries are a supporting role. For instance, there will routinely be a technical Emissary to help creators figure out tech issues, and potentially an aide Emissary to keep communications around and within a project in order.</p>
<p>Oversight Committees hold no voting power in the project, facilitation (and getting out the way when they’re not needed) is their key activity.</p>
<h3 id="champions"><a class="header" href="#champions">Champions</a></h3>
<p>Discovery is a hard problem to solve. Everyone and their grandmother seem to have ideas, but even those who are capable of executing often find it impossible to do so in a vacuum.</p>
<p>The expectation is that the Pipeline community will grow organically and so will the number of projects launched, but for that to happen we might want word-of-mouth to actually go around. Authors often will not be able to solve this on their own.</p>
<p>For a project freshly submitted and not attracting sufficient interest from the existing body of Governors, and even for a project partially funded by Governors, it’s beneficial if Champions exist, social butterflies that bring in more Governors and/or Backers and any other types of participants. </p>
<p>Champions receive a small equity in the project, based on the amount of funding they’ve attracted (thinking simple affiliate links here.) They do not vote on the project matters.</p>
<h3 id="backers"><a class="header" href="#backers">Backers</a></h3>
<p>When a project isn’t funded in its entirety by Governors, it is open for contributions by Backers who will fill in the missing funds. In such case, anyone with access to Pipeline may choose to become a Backer and receive project-specific equity token in return.</p>
<p>Backers also receive voting rights in the project. </p>
<h3 id="authorcreatorcreative-collective"><a class="header" href="#authorcreatorcreative-collective">Author/Creator/Creative Collective</a></h3>
<p>The leading creative mind or minds behind a project. Not to be confused with the entire team working to make project a reality. This would be a person or persons who have the final say in the project’s creative vision and will steer the team (if there’s one) toward that vision.</p>
<p>Author receives a share in the project and depending on the project parameters could also be receiving fixed payments while working on the project.</p>
<p>Like Governors, they will also receive a disproportional share of the voting power. TBD.</p>
<h3 id="collaborators"><a class="header" href="#collaborators">Collaborators</a></h3>
<p>Collaborators help Authors execute their vision. All types of skilled specialists required to make a creative project reality fall into this group.</p>
<p>A special type of a collaborator is a QA Collaborator. This person will ensure that milestones are delivered on with due quality. (Note: might want to make this one an Emissary actually.)</p>
<h3 id="influencers"><a class="header" href="#influencers">Influencers</a></h3>
<p>Influencers are a subtype of Backers; they do not invest financially (although they could), but based on documented promotional support for a project they’re eligible for remuneration in much the same way.</p>
<h3 id="distribution-outlet"><a class="header" href="#distribution-outlet">Distribution Outlet</a></h3>
<p>Once the project has delivered a product, one or more distribution outlets will begin making the product available to the general public. Governors, Committee members, Wardens, Collaborators, and Influencers are all entitled to receive the product/access to the product free of charge. This makes everyone else potentially interested in the product a paying customer.</p>
<h3 id="agents"><a class="header" href="#agents">Agents</a></h3>
<p>Anyone can submit a project. This opens the platform to existing entities, such as established agents, publishers, rights owners, etc. There’s an open question of how to prevent such existing entities from implementing their usual balls-busting practices, we will address that later.</p>
<p>Agents will also work on exploiting IP emerging under Pipeline by engineering and closing media deals, which would be a part of a project’s life cycle past the point of delivering a tangible product.</p>
<h3 id="law-actors"><a class="header" href="#law-actors">Law Actors</a></h3>
<p>It is paramount for a Pipeline project to both abstain from violating copyrights and, to the extent possible, to keep others from violating its own intellectual property. To this end, the protocol must be endowed with an international legal team providing intellectual property operations on the boundaries between the web3 world and the real world.</p>
<p>The legal team is also a shareholder in the projects it administers and is held accountable by the community and the authors behind the projects.</p>
