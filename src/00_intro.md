# Introduction

*Pipeline* is a DAO protocol that synchronizes the goals of creators, publishers, producers, agents, influencers, and audiences, thus streamlining the processes of funding, creating, distributing, and profiting off intellectual and creative property.

Its purpose is to connect creators with audiences by bulldozing the gatekeeping mechanisms of the past and creating self-organizing, autonomous economies in their place.

### Problem Statement

- To be considered successful, art and entertainment products must satisfy the goals of three key constituents: the creator, the target audience, and the organization invested in production.
- Traditional *creator*→*publisher*→*market*→*feedback* loops suffer from the goals of these three constituents being at odds with one another:
    - **Creators strive to make a living by connecting to audiences.**
    - **Consumers look for outstanding, fresh stories that they’ll love.**
    - **Publishers minimize risk and maximize profit.**

The traditional publishing system, with its gatekeeping and mass-market inclinations, makes successful pieces of great entertainment a rarity (compared to what could be) and imposes unfair allocation and distribution of resources.

As (hopefully) stated in this somewhat dated overview, a certain maturity level and field-specific skills are required of an organization producing entertainment products, and there are good reasons *why* such organizational specialization exists — that is, book publishers specialize in books, studios in movies, and so on.

However, a key insight into these production processes is that they are extremely well researched and long established. At this junction, *if one team can do it, another team can do it as well*.

The hurdle to that is, *Who has the time, the money, and the skill to organize the entire production and distribution pipeline*?

### Proposed Solution

- Pipeline deconstructs and reassembles the processes of ideation, financing, production, promotion, and distribution in a decentralized fashion.
- Decisions on which projects to fund are made by the DAO community, based on direct voting, where votes are expressed in stablecoin amounts.
- Launched projects strictly adhere to production templates specific to the type of projects.
- Project funding is unlocked in stages and is milestone-based.
- Actors in each Pipeline (investors, creators, collaborators, influencers, curators, agents, etc) are issued profit-sharing tokens.
- Each project is closely followed by a designated body of DAO members (Emissaries and Wardens).
- Working against the interests of the DAO results in slashing of assets for members found to be in violation.
- *Self-organizing* and *autonomous* are the key guiding principles.

# Success Criteria

1. Constant growth of the project base.
2. Positive ROI for everyone involved.
3. Emergence of new/improved project templates.
