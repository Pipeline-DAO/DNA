# Values & Principles

Note: the word "actors" here means "participants with agency," not to be confused with film actors.

### Autonomy
1. Pipeline's protocol and infrastructure run independently of any external shareholders.
2. Actors participating in the protocol and using its infrastructure are sovereign decision makers.

### Decentralization
1. Pipeline's protocol and infrastructure run in a decentralized, unstoppable fashion.
2. During the bootstrap period, the system will temporarily rely on centralized solutions (mostly for UI purposes.)
3. Once the system is fully operational, all upgrades and augmentations will be voted on by the community of actors.

### Self-Organization
Pipeline replaces decision-making by a committee of high-level stakeholders with decision-making by a community of equal peers. Project templates, creative visions, shared profit, and market feedback are to become the lines along which the organizing activity takes place. 

### Accountability
Peers being equal also means they're equally reponsible for the outcomes. Every single actor is accountable to the community and the protocol, which, together, will define how to best punish harmful behaviors. 

Counterbalancing that is reputation. The better the rep, the more the protocol will trust an actor with making decisions that reflect on the whole of Pipeline.

### Predictability
Established production processes and best practices are the guiding light for Pipeline projects.

This concerns the technical operations involved in creating a product and the production values.

But has no bearing on the creative side of things where unpredictability and intuitive search are often winning strategies.

### Creative Sovereignty
Creators and creative collectives are granted full creative freedom as long as their work is not in violation of third party rights and does not promote morals disrespectful to humans.

There will be lines of division in matters of morals, and it is ultimately up to the DAO to decide which lines can be crossed for artistic reasons and based on story requirements... and which are completely off-limits.


### Respect of Rights
1. Work produced through Pipeline shall not violate copyright or other relevant rights knowingly.
2. Certain actors in the community (Champions, Emissaries, Wardens) could potentially be responsible for reviewing prior art to avoid situations of unpremeditated violations.

### Openness
Anyone can be a Pipeline actor.

### Meritocracy
1. Anyone can be a Pipeline actor based on what they bring to the table. 
2. Not based on how rich they are. Pipeline is to be averse to meritocracy.


### Evolvability
A stagnant system is a dead one. Within the confines of values and principles set here, Pipeline is expected to evolve over time based on decisions made by the community.
