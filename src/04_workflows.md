# Workflows

### Request for Proposals → End Product. 
We start with a public need that could be satisfied by crowdfunding a production pipeline. RfPs could be targeted at specific producers (in the general sense of the word)

### Request for Funding → End Product. 
We start with an existing idea that, if it gets enough traction and is funded, will result in a product.
