# Questions

### How do we generate hype? :)
Not a big fan of that part, but hype could be useful.

Open to suggestions.

The hype detractor of the system as described is the absence of speculative earnings, at least initially.


### Value Extraction?
Initially I thought the protocol would take a small fee from all the projects Pipeline launches.

But again, open to suggestions because after reading about hyperstructures I'm somewhat on the fence about this approach.

LMK your thoughts.
