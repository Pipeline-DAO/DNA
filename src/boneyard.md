A typical project will be split into milestones, consistent with stints required to deliver the particular type of project. Funding is split into milestones as well and is contingent on the author delivering the goods.
When a milestone is reached, relevant deliverables are published, and the designated QA Collaborator(s) confirm(s) that everything is a-okay, the funding for the next stint is released by the Oversight Committee.
On most projects, because Governors and Backers become shareholders, there will be a stipulation that if the Author is to drop out of the process for whatever reason, community is free to replace them in order to finish the project (after a grace period.)
If one of the Collaborator is seen as unfit or drops out, the community is free to make a similar decision.
The ownership structure is established during the initial phase, before Pipeline funding is greenlit. This will specify all the terms and conditions of funding and subsequent exploitation of rights, token emission, shares, etc.
Ownership structure is extremely flexible in how the proceeds from a project are allocated.

It is paramount for decision makers in Pipeline processes to have skin in the game and bear the consequences of acting against interests of the whole community. Thus all activity and deliverables are subject to public scrutiny, all consequential decisions have built-in delays and grace periods, and at any moment in time the larger community could hold a vote on any matter, even small ones.
If a party is found responsible for acting against the interests of the whole community, their holdings will be slashed and the $PIPE thus recovered will be sent to the treasury.

Funds currently not in use in the Pipeline treasury can be used in providing liquidity to a lending platform.
Same goes for funds locked in a specific Pipeline project.
When an actual tranche payment is made, the corresponding amount is withdrawn from the lending platform.


Discovery
Siloed structure of potential projects evolving under the patronage of Pipeline simplifies discovery. Itâ€™s easy enough to subdivide branches into genres, assign hash tags for content filtering, etc, thus making navigating projects delivered and projects underway a non-issue.
On the outside, Influencers will facilitate en masse discovery by promoting certain projects to their audiences.

Liquidity Acquisition
While DAO members holding governance tokens are the key decision-makers and projects evolve based on their votes, additional liquidity could be attracted into the treasury by emitting non-voting tokens in exchange for funds. To avoid diluting profits shared across voting holders, such liquidity will be accepted when it needs to be allocated to projects, not under other circumstances.


Full-Circle Enterprise
Pipeline aims to enable the entire cycle of creation, from ideation to distribution to sequelization/iterative improvement. To achieve that, it combines crowdsourcing, crowdfunding, and crowdbuilding with decentralized governance mechanics.
The community behind a Pipeline project simultaneously serves as the source of inspiration, the source of necessary investments, the source and the destination of workforce, and the source of decision-making.
It could be seen as a community-driven smart money rolling VC fund and a trusted execution environment for creative projects.

One could say, Pipeline is for well researched processes as opposed to startup-type endeavours.
