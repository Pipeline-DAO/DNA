# On Treasury Elasticity
Various ponzi-like setups promising high APY, which is self-cannibalizing in the long run and isn’t sustainable without ongoing hype, are another type of “tempting” crypto propositions.  Liquidity providers in such pools jump ship at the first sign of trouble, and the protocol in question quickly becomes insolvent due to the domino effect.

I will now explain how this approach, sadly, doesn’t work in our case for attracting hype type liquidity to the project.

The way I’m envisioning Pipeline DAO utilizing the liquidity from the treasury is, *funding projects* and *generating voting rights*.

When a project is funded, liquidity will be locked in that project and parties are now holders of the project-specific token that confers shareholding superpowers :) on these parties. When the project is released and (hopefully) begins generating ROI, the first thing that happens is that the initial investment is repaid in full, so everyone involved gets their money back and can now either invest in something else or take the funds out of the treasury.

The project-specific token will keep generating income forever (or until the date set in the project parameters). It becomes its own asset and can be traded. The ROI performance is also a metric that can be used to assess the wisdom of the DAO.

DAO members will retain their voting rights even as the liquidity goes toward funding projects. These can be exercised for voting on project matters and global DAO matters, like augmenting and adding project templates.

In all, DAO members *do not* get ROI until they’re actively investing, but they do get to vote.

This will probably lead to situations, where most projects are funded just-in-time, and the treasury holdings being zero when a project is submitted, although not necessarily. I call this property of Pipeline’s treasury *elasticity*: we don’t care how much is in the treasury, what we do care about is promising projects getting funded. When we have an attractive submission that caters to Pipeline’s core values, it’s up to the community in general to decide whether they want to go with it and fund the treasury with the amount necessary to launch.

If there’s no financial incentive to locking funds in the treasury, hype liquidity providers will not care to provide liquidity. In theory we could design a mechanism by which locking money in treasury does provide financial incentive; but I do feel it would be not so straightforward to do without destabilizing or tainting parts of the system.

Another thing to note here is that projects funded through Pipeline do not necessarily promise the same returns as crypto investors are used to in general. We’re talking more conservative investing, which still has opportunities for big returns, but such cases will mostly be rooted in non-speculative scenarios.

As time goes, however, projects are released to the general public and start bringing in ROI, the reputation of certain investors is going to rise (while reputation of others will decline), giving hype liquidity a way in. We could consider allowing “piggyback investments” where funding decisions are delegated by liquidity providers to DAO members with good history of investing and these DAO members get access to more capital, which allows them to fund more projects or larger projects. Piggyback investors do not attain voting rights, but they do become shareholders in projects funded by reputable DAO members. 

Because the demand for liquidity is elastic, this does not guarantee everyone a way in. Reputable DAO members could be putting out slots to be filled, based on the projects that are currently under consideration. For instance, in situations when a reputable investor considers a project a great investment, but the reception of the DAO as a whole isn’t warm enough to launch the project, they could seek piggyback capital.
